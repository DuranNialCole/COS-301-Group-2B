1.1 Programming languages
	-Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java programming language application programming 
	interface specification that describes the management of relational data in applications 
	using Java Platform, Standard Edition and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.
1.2 Database technologies
	-Java Persistence query language (JPQL) is used to define searches against persistent entities
	independent of the mechanism used to store those entities. As such, JPQL is "portable", 
	and not constrained to any particular data store.
1.3 Application servers
	The application server chosen will be the Apache server. Apache server
	is open source allowing modification if required, it is cost effective due to the nature of being
	open source. It is portable allowing it to be installed on any system.
1.4 Testing modules
	The build tool Apache Maven(Software project management) will be used for unittesting.
	Maven can run unittest which allows the sharing and integration of code between seperate tests 
	such as the start up and shutdown of testing. It allows Command-Line interface as well as code 
	imbedded testing. Unittest has functionality to re-use old test code instead of designing the test code over.
