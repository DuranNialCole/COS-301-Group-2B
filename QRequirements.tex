\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Scalability}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Multiple user 
		\item Manage resource demand
		\item Scale out resources
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item\textbf{Performance requirements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Throughput: The rate at which incoming requests are completed
		\item Manage resource demand
		\item Response times
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Maintainability}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Regression
		\item Correcting defects
		\item Corrective maintenance: Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems.
		\item Adaptive maintenance: Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment.
		\item Perfective maintenance: Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability.
		\item Preventive maintenance: Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Reliability and Availability}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Prevent faults
		\item Detect faults
		\item Recover from faults
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Security}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Detect attacks 
		\item Resist attacks
		\item Recover from attack
		\item Authentication
		\item Authorization
		\item Minimize access
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Monitorability and Auditability}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Logs: Logs system activities such as the time a user logged into/out of the system
		\item 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Testability}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Controllability: The degree to which it is possible to control the state of the component under test as required for testing.
		\item Understandability: The degree to which the component under test is documented or self-explaining.
		\item Test driven development
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Usability}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Efficiency
		\item Ease of use
		\item Learnability
		\item Satisfaction (How pleasant is it to use the design?)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Integrability}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Integration Channel: Web, Mobile
		\item Protocols: 
		\item Quality requirements: 
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{enumerate}
