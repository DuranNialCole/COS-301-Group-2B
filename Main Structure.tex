\newpage
\section{Architecture Requirements}
	\subsection{Architectural Scope}
	The following responsibilities need to be addressed by the software architecture:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To be able to host and provide an execution environment for the services/business logic of the Buzz system
		\item To provide an infrastructure for a web access channel
		\item To provide an infrastructure that provides a mobile access channel
		\item To provide an infrastructure that handles persisting and provides access to domain objects
		\item To integrate with a LDAP repository.
		\item To provide an infrastructure that allows module plugability in such a way that core modules are independent from add on modules and vice-versa
		\item To provide an infrastructure to integrate the system with other systems such as the CS department's website and the Hamster marking system
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Quality Requirements}
	
	The following quality requirements are in order of the most important to least important.	
	\subsubsection{Critical:}
	\subsubsection*{Usability}
	The average student should be able to use the Buzz system without any prior training and not be discouraged to use the system again. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Buzz system interface must be efficient and easy to use and navigate.
		\item Initially only English needs to be supported, but the system must allow for translations to the other official languages of the University of Pretoria to be added at a later stage.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection*{Scalability}
	It is important that a large number of users can be accommodated by the Buzz system.
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item Manage resource demand to ensure that every user of the Buzz system will be presented with a satisfactory experience.
		\item Scale out resources to ensure that resource demand be met.
		\item The system must be able to operate effectively under the load of all registered students within the department of Computer Science and guest users.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\subsubsection{Important:}
	\subsubsection*{Availability}
	It is important that the Buzz system is always accessible by the user.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Adequately test each module of the Buzz system to minimize downtime to ensure that the system can function even if a module is down.
		\item The Buzz system is accessible by multiple platforms and browsers.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection*{Integrability}
	The Buzz system must be able to communicate with the existing CS modules without changing the Buzz system.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Must be able to integrate with existing systems and systems which may want to be added.
		\item Must be able to integrate with the existing CS website.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection*{Maintainability}
	The Buzz system must be maintained to keep the system in as safe state.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Rollback to a previous state in which the Buzz system was safe. Lets us recover from an error or a system fault.
		\item Corrective maintenance is to correct discovered problems in the Buzz system after the system has been implemented.
		\item Perfective maintenance is to improve performance or maintainability after the Buzz system has been implemented.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection*{Testability}
	The modules of the Buzz system must be tested thoroughly before they are deployed to the final system.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Buzz system must use test driven development.
		\item Each service provided by the system must be testable through a unit test that tests:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item That the service is provided if all pre-conditions are met, and
			\item That all post-conditions hold true once the service has been provided.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection*{Monitorability and Auditability}
	The Buzz system must keep track of system and user activities that can be audited at a later stage.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each action on the system must be recorded in an audit log that can later be viewed and queried.
		\item Information to be recorded must include:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The identity of the individual carrying out the action.
			\item A description of the action.
			\item When the action was carried out.
		\end{itemize}						
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Nice to have:}
	
	\subsubsection*{Security}
	Sensitive information of the users must be kept secure. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Minimize access and permissions given to users who do not have the required privileges.
		\item All communication of sensitive data must be done securely through encryption and secure channels such that unwanted users are unable to compromise the Buzz system.
		\item All system functionality is only accessible to users who can be successfully authenticated through the LDAP system used by the department of Computer Science.
	\end{itemize}		
	
	\subsubsection*{Performance requirements}
	Minimize the response time of requests from the Buzz system to ensure that the Buzz system would work efficiently.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Buzz system must have a large throughput number such that the rate at which incoming requests are completed is high.
	\end{itemize}
					

	\subsection{Architectural Constraints}		
	The following architecture constraints have been imposed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system must be developed using the following technologies
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Development must take place on a distribution of the Linux operating system
		\item The system must be developed using the Java-Enterprise Edition (Java-EE) development platform and the Java Server Faces (JSF) architectural framework
		\item Persistence to a relational database must be done by making use of the Java Persistence API (JPA) and the Java Persistence query language (JPQL)
		\item The unit tests should be developed using using an appropriate unit test framework such as JUnit (a unit testing framework for the Java programming language).
	\end{itemize}

	\item The system must ultimately be deployed onto a GlassFish application server running on the cs.up.ac.za Apache web server.
	\item The system must be decoupled from the choice of database. The system will use a MySQL database.
	\item The system must expose all system functionality as restful web services and hence may not have any application functionality within the presentation layer.
	\item Web services must be published as either SOAP-based or Restful web services.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Architectural patterns or styles}
	\subsection{Layered Architectural Style}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Buzz system can at its simplest be implemented across the following three layers:
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item Client access layer
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Provides the front-end/interface through which the client interacts with the system
				\item Thin client in the form of a web interface which will simply handle input from the user and display appropriate output
				\end{itemize}
			\item Business logic layer
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Provides the back-end services of the system
				\item Manages authentication via communication with CS LDAP
				\item Manages access to the persistence database
				\item The aim of having the back-end managing the data is to achieve higher security.
				\end{itemize}
			\item Infrastructure layer
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Includes the framework upon which the system is built and provides integration with other systems
				\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}		
		\item The main benefits of layered architectural style:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item it abstracts the view of the system as whole while providing enough detail to understand the roles and responsibilities of individual layers and the relationship between them.
			\item separation of concerns across different layers improves cohesion and reduces complexity
			\item improved maintainability through the ability to have separate layers developed
independently by different teams
			\item testability is improved by separation of concerns leading to smaller independent modules which can be tested
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
\section{Architectural tactics or strategies}

	\subsection{Fault Detection}
		\subsubsection{Ping / Echo}			
			\begin{itemize}		
				\item Ping / Echo refers to an asynchronous request/response message pair exchanged between nodes, used to determine reachability and the round-trip delay through the associated network path. We can use it to ensure that the students are connected and up to date with the latest version of a Buzzspace before they post something that might already have been posted.
				\item The quality requirements addressed:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Security, as it can confirms on security policies between ports and that no faults have occurred.
						\item Availability, allows us to note whether server is available or not.
						\item Reliability, detected faults can then be acted upon. 
						\item Monitor-ability and Audibility, To log faults detected.
						\item Testability, allows errors to be found and dealt with.
					\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
			
		\subsubsection{ Exception Detection }
			\begin{itemize}
			\item System Exceptions are raised by the system when it detects a fault, such as divide by zero, bus and address faults and illegal program instructions.
			
			\item Parameter Fence incorporates an A priority data pattern (such as 0xdeadbeef) placed immediately after any variable-length parameters of an object. It allows for runtime detection of overwriting the memory allocated for the object's variable-length parameters.
			
			\item Parameter Typing employs a base class that defines functions that add, find, and iterate over Type-Length-Value (TLV) formatted message parameters and uses strong typing to build and parse messages.
			
			\item All exceptions needs to be handled in order to prevent any critical errors or failures which can lead to a system compromise.
			
			\item The quality requirements addressed:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Security, Allows us to detect possible security errors and threats such as: buffer overflows, possible attacks, etc.
				\item Maintainability, Allows us to find and fix exceptions which could further lead to system errors and problems.
				\item Monitor-ability and Audibility, To monitor system and log all exceptions thrown by either system or user activities.
				\item Testability, allows exceptions to be found and dealt with.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Fault Recovery}
		
		\subsubsection{Rollback}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Rollback is a checkpoint based tactic that allows the system state to be reverted to the most recent consistent set of checkpoints.
	
			\item The quality requirements addressed:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Testability, allows the system to remain intact while new components are tested.
				\item Maintainability, allows us to backtrack to a state where components where working correctly.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Fault Prevention}
		\begin{itemize}
			
			\item Removal from Service\\
			Places a system component in an out-of-service state that allows for mitigating potential system failures before their accumulation affects the service.
			
			\item Transactions\\
			Ensures a consistent and durable system state. The Atomic Commit Protocol can be used and it is most commonly implemented by the two-phase commit.
			
			\item Process Monitor\\
			Monitors the state of health of a system process and ensures that the system is operating within its nominal operating parameters.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Optimization}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Scheduling and Queuing\\
			Queuing and scheduling can be combined to get the optimal performance out of the limited resources available on the server. As the requests come in they are put into a queue to implement fairness and then the requests in the queue is scheduled for effectiveness and efficiency.
			\item Pooling\\
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Thread\\
					Thread pooling is when instead of creating new threads the whole time, we recycle old ones. Each time a thread is no longer being used, it goes into the "pool" and sits there waiting to be re-implemented. Now you don't have to use all the time and processing power to create new threads, you can just update an already existing one to reflect a new thread.
					\item Connection\\
					Connection pooling will allow multiple connections that spawn from the same network to re-use each others connections. This prevents the server being kept busy with a lot of empty connections and thus will free up more processing power for the live connections.
				\end{itemize}
			\item The quality requirements addressed:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Scalability, by managing the resources so that they're used in a minimalistic way.
				\item Performance, by controlling the creation and deletion of connections and threads.
				\item Availability, by optimizing the processing of the requests.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
