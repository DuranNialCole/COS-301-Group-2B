1 Protocols
1.1 HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
	The system will make use of HTTP to receive requests and send responses through the
	different access channels. This protocol will define the communication between the sytem
	and web browsers.
1.2 HTTPS - HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
	The system will make use of HTTPS when communicating sensitive data through dif-
	ferent access channels.
1.3 JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
	The system will make use of the JSON protocol to marshal response objects that are re-
	quested by other systems. 
	-JSON is the preferred marshaling protocol due to it being efficient
	and lightweight. 
	-When compared to XML, the JSON marshaled objects are smaller in size
	and the time taken to process them is less.
1.4 LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
	The system will make use of the LDAP system used by the Department of Computer Sci-
	ence. This system contains the details of the users of the system. Thus the users will be
	authenticated through this LDAP system. 
	-LDAP is both efficient and low cost.
