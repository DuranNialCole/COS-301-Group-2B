\section{Architecture requirements}
The purpose of this section is to describe the software architecture requirements so as to address the non-functional requirements. In particular, the architecture requirements will specify:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the access and integration requirements for the system,
	\item the architectural responsibilities which need to be addressed,
	\item the quality requirements, and
	\item the architecture constraints.
\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Access and Integration requirements}
		\subsubsection{Access Channels}
		The system should be accessible by human users through only the following channel:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Through a web browser through a web interface. The system must be accessible from all of the widely used web browsers including all of the most recent versions of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Mozilla Firefox.
		\end{itemize}

Other systems should be able to access the services offered by the system through either restful or SOAP-based web services.
